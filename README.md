# Introduction
The release of version 3 of the popular ESA/ESO/NASA Photoshop FITS Liberator image processing software has meant that it is even easier and faster to create colour images using raw observations from a range of telescopes, including the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope, ESO’s Very Large Telescope and ESA’s XMM-Newton Telescope.

As with the previous versions of the FITS Liberator, the version 3 makes another leap towards making the creation of colour images from raw astronomical observations easier and faster. The FITS Liberator continues to support the FITS and PDS formats, preferred by astronomers and planetary scientists respectively, which enables data to be processed from a wide range of telescopes and planetary probes, including ESO’s Very Large Telescope, the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope, ESA’s XMM–Newton Telescope and Cassini–Huygens or Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.

The new FITS Liberator incorporates a faster and more streamlined workflow. The CPU-intensive calculations have been optimised, thanks to significantly improved memory management, and this allows for time savings of up to 35%. For large images the savings in efficiency are even more pronounced, also thanks to a delayed application of stretch functions.

To sustain the future development of the software the entire source code, consisting of nearly 30 000 lines of code is being released as open source, and anyone wishing to contribute to future versions of the programme may do so.

## Version 3.0 of the FITS Liberator include the following new features:

* FITS Liberator is now a stand-alone application, which means that Photoshop is no longer required.
* Processing medium-sized images is now up to 35% faster, thanks to significantly improved memory management.
* Processing large images are also faster thanks to delayed application of stretch functions.
* FITS Liberator saves TIFF files that open in virtually any image processing software.
* Open-source code base available on [https://github.com/esoobservatory/fitsliberator/](https://github.com/esoobservatory/fitsliberator/).

# Download

Download from [www.spacetelescope.org](http://www.spacetelescope.org/projects/fits_liberator/download_v30/)

# Requirements

Minimum requirements:

* Windows PC (XP, Vista or Windows 7, all 32 or 64 bit) or Mac (OS X 10.5+)
* Screen resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels or better

Other limitations:

* As the loading process is very I/O intensive, the performance may be decreased significantly when loading FITS files from a network drive. In this case the program will show a notification. It is recommended, if possible, to copy files to the local hard disk drive before opening them with the FITS Liberator.
